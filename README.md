Glitter: A Twitter Clone Project
================================

Summary
-------

This project is our first attempt at using action mailer to send automated email messages from a Ruby on Rails app.

Completed:

* As a user, I want to be able to sign up so I have a glitter account that I can use to share stuff with my peeps.
* As a user, I want to receive an automatic welcome email so that I can confirm my account was created
* As a user, I want to be able to sign in with a username and password so that I can post content.

User Stories to do:

* As a user, I want to be able to follow other users so I can see their content automatically.
* As a user, I want to be able to mention other users in my posts so that the mentioned user is alerted to my post.
* As a user, I want to receive an email notification when another user mentions me, so I know when people are talking about me.
* As a user, I want to receive an email notification when another user follows me, so I know who is interested in my content.
* As a user, I want to be able to view all of my followers or all of another users followers.
* As a user, I want to upload photos so I can share my selfies with the world. Because the world needs more selfies.
* As a user, I want to be able to browse through endless page after page of content. AKA pagination.
* As a user, I want to be able to set my notification preferences so I can control what email I get from Glitter.
